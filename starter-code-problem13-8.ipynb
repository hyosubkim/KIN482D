    "The code below gets you well on your way to plotting one combination of D (distance between target centers) and $\\sigma_\\text{motor}$. Testing different combinations of D and $\\sigma_\\text{motor}$ for part (b) just requires adding a couple more values for each. The easiest way to do that is through the use of for loops. "
