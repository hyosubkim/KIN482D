    "\n",
    "- \"The Kalman filter is over 50 years old but is still one of the most important and common data fusion algorithms in use today.\" (Ramsey Faragher, BAE Systems Advanced Technology Centre, UK)\n",
    "- \"The Kalman filter has long been regarded as the optimal solution to many tracking and data prediction tasks.\" (Tony Lacey, MIT)\n",
    "- \"Kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of U.S. Navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines, and in the guidance and navigation systems of cruise missiles such as the U.S. Navy's Tomahawk missile and the U.S. Air Force's Air Launched Cruise Missile. They are also used in the guidance and navigation systems of reusable launch vehicles and the attitude control and navigation systems of spacecraft which dock at the International Space Station.\" (Wikipedia entry)\n",
    "- \"For a linear system, the Kalman filter is the optimal observer in that it estimates the state with the least squared error. Such a model has been supported by empirical studies examining estimation of hand position, posture, and head orientation.\" (Daniel Wolpert and Zoubin Ghahramani, *Nature* 2000)\n",
